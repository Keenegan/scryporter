# Scryporter

When searching for cards on [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/), you might find exactly the cards you need — but there's a problem: **Scryfall doesn't provide a way to export card names from your search results.**

## The Solution

[Scryporter](https://keenegan.github.io/scryporter/index.html) is a lightweight tool that solves this problem. Simply:

1. Copy your Scryfall search query
2. Paste it into Scryporter
3. Click Search

Scryporter will retrieve **all matching cards** and export a clean list of card names ready to paste directly into your buying list or any other tool.
