# Scryporter

Scryporter is a lightweight client-side tool that retrieves card names from the Scryfall API based on any Scryfall search query or URL.

Paste your Scryfall query, click Search, and Scryporter will fetch all matching cards — including paginated results — and output the list of card names.

This makes it easy to transfer search results into external tools such as Cardmarket, spreadsheets, deck builders, or inventory systems.
